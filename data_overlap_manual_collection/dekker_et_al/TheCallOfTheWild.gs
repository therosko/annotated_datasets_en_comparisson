did O
not O
read O
the O

he O
would O

known O
that O

was O

not O

with O
warm O
, O
long O
hair O
, O
from O
Puget O
Sound O
to O
San O
Diego O
. O
Because O
men O
, O
groping O
in O
the O
Arctic O
darkness O
, O
had O
found O
a O
yellow O
metal O
, O
and O
because O
steamship O

companies O
were O
booming O
the O
find O
, O
thousands O
of O
men O
were O
rushing O
into O
the O
Northland O
. O
These O
men O
wanted O
dogs O
, O
and O
the O
dogs O
they O
wanted O
were O
heavy O
dogs O
, O
with O
strong O
muscles O

which O

Buck I-PERSON
lived O
at O
a O
big O
house O
in O

Santa O
Clara O

. O
Judge I-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
's O
place O
, O
it O
was O
called O
. O
It O
stood O
back O
from O
the O
road O
, O
half O
hidden O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
through O
which O
glimpses O
could O
be O
caught O
of O
the O
wide O
cool O
veranda O
that O
ran O
around O
its O
four O
sides O
. O
The O
house O
was O
approached O
by O
gravelled O
driveways O
which O
wound O
about O
through O
wide O
- O
spreading O
lawns O
and O
under O
the O
interlacing O
boughs O
of O
tall O
poplars O
. O
At O
the O
rear O
things O
were O
on O
even O
a O
more O
spacious O
scale O
than O
at O
the O
front O
. O
There O
were O
great O
stables O
, O
where O
a O
dozen O
grooms O
and O
boys O
held O
forth O
, O
rows O
of O
vine O
- O
clad O
servants O
' O
cottages O
, O
an O
endless O
and O
orderly O
array O

, O
long O
grape O
arbors O
, O
green O

, O
orchards O
, O
and O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
pumping O
plant O
for O
the O
artesian O
well O
, O
and O
the O
big O
cement O
tank O
where O
Judge I-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
's O
boys O
took O
their O
morning O
plunge O
and O
kept O
cool O
in O
the O
hot O
afternoon O
. O
And O
over O
this O
great O
demesne O
Buck I-PERSON
ruled O
. O
Here O
he O
was O
born O
, O
and O
here O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
four O
years O
of O
his O
life O
. O
It O
was O
true O
, O
there O
were O
other O
dogs O
, O
There O
could O
not O
but O
be O
other O
dogs O
on O
so O
vast O
a O
place O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
count O
. O
They O
came O
and O
went O
, O
resided O
in O
the O
populous O
kennels O
, O
or O
lived O
obscurely O
in O
the O
recesses O
of O
the O
house O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
Toots I-PERSON
, O
the O
Japanese O
pug O
, O
or O
Ysabel I-PERSON
, O
the O
Mexican O
hairless O
, O
-- O
strange O
creatures O
that O
rarely O
put O
nose O
out O
of O
doors O
or O
set O
foot O
to O
ground O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
were O
the O
fox O
terriers O
, O
a O
score O
of O
them O
at O
least O
, O
who O
yelped O
fearful O
promises O
at O
Toots I-PERSON
and O
Ysabel I-PERSON
looking O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
at O
them O
and O
protected O
by O
a O
legion O
of O
housemaids O
armed O
with O
brooms O
and O
mops O
. O
But O
Buck I-PERSON
was O
neither O
house O
- O
dog O
nor O
kennel O
- O
dog O
. O
The O
whole O
realm O
was O
his O
. O
He O
plunged O
into O
the O
swimming O
tank O
or O
went O
hunting O
with O
the O
Judge I-PERSON
's O
sons O
; O
he O
escorted O
Mollie I-PERSON
and O
Alice I-PERSON
, O
the O
Judge I-PERSON
's O
daughters O
, O
on O
long O
twilight O
or O
early O
morning O
rambles O
; O
on O
wintry O
nights O
he O
lay O
at O
the O
Judge I-PERSON
's O
feet O
before O
the O
roaring O
library O
fire O
; O
he O
carried O
the O
Judge I-PERSON
's O
grandsons O
on O
his O
back O
, O
or O
rolled O
them O
in O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
guarded O
their O
footsteps O
through O
wild O
adventures O
down O
to O
the O
fountain O
in O
the O
stable O
yard O
, O
and O
even O
beyond O
, O
where O
the O
paddocks O
were O
, O
and O
the O
berry O
patches O
. O
Among O
the O
terriers O
he O
stalked O
imperiously O
, O
and O
Toots I-PERSON
and O
Ysabel I-PERSON
he O
utterly O
ignored O
, O
for O
he O
was O
king O
, O
-- O
king O
over O
all O
creeping O
, O
crawling O
, O
flying O
things O
of O
Judge I-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
's O
place O
, O
humans O
included O
. O
His O
father O
, O
Elmo I-PERSON
, O
a O
huge O
St. O
Bernard O
, O
had O
been O
the O
Judge I-PERSON
's O
inseparable O
companion O
, O
and O
Buck I-PERSON
bid O
fair O
to O
follow O
in O
the O
way O
of O
his O
father O
. O
He O
was O
not O
so O
large O
, O
-- O
he O
weighed O
only O
one O
hundred O
and O
forty O
pounds O
, O
-- O
for O
his O
mother O
, O
Shep I-PERSON
, O
had O
been O
a O
Scotch O
shepherd O
dog O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
one O
hundred O
and O
forty O
pounds O
, O
to O
which O
was O
added O
the O
dignity O
that O
comes O
of O
good O
living O
and O
universal O
respect O
, O
enabled O
him O
to O
carry O
himself O
in O
right O
royal O
fashion O
. O
During O
the O
four O
years O
since O
his O
puppyhood O
he O
had O
lived O
the O
life O
of O
a O
sated O
aristocrat O
; O
he O
had O
a O
fine O
pride O
in O
himself O
, O
was O
even O
a O
trifle O
egotistical O
, O
as O
country O
gentlemen O
sometimes O
become O
because O
of O
their O
insular O
situation O
. O
But O
he O
had O
saved O
himself O
by O
not O
becoming O
a O
mere O
pampered O
house O
- O
dog O
. O
Hunting O
and O
kindred O
outdoor O
delights O
had O
kept O
down O
the O
fat O
and O
hardened O
his O
muscles O
; O
and O
to O
him O
, O
as O
to O
the O
cold O
- O
tubbing O
races O
, O
the O
love O
of O
water O
had O
been O
a O
tonic O
and O
a O
health O
preserver O
. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
manner O
of O
dog O
Buck I-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1897 O
, O
when O
the O
Klondike O
strike O
dragged O
men O
from O
all O
the O
world O
into O
the O
frozen O
North O
. O
But O
Buck I-PERSON
did O
not O
read O
the O
newspapers O
, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Manuel I-PERSON
, O
one O
of O
the O
gardener O
's O
helpers O
, O
was O
an O
undesirable O
acquaintance O
. O
Manuel I-PERSON
had O
one O
besetting O
sin O
. O
He O
loved O
to O
play O
Chinese O
lottery O
. O
Also O
, O
in O
his O
gambling O
, O
he O
had O
one O
besetting O
weakness O
-- O
faith O
in O
a O
system O
; O
and O
this O
made O
his O
damnation O
certain O
. O
For O
to O
play O
a O
system O
requires O
money O
, O
while O
the O
wages O
of O
a O
gardener O
's O
helper O
do O
not O
lap O
over O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
wife O
and O
numerous O
progeny O
. O
The O
Judge I-PERSON
was O
at O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
Raisin O
Growers O
' O
Association O
, O
and O
the O
boys O
were O
busy O
organizing O
an O
athletic O
club O
, O
on O
the O
memorable O
night O
of O
Manuel I-PERSON
's O
treachery O
. O
No O
one O
saw O
him O
and O
Buck I-PERSON
go O
off O
through O
the O
orchard O
on O
what O
Buck I-PERSON
imagined O
was O
merely O
a O
stroll O
. O
And O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
solitary O
man O
, O
no O
one O
saw O
them O
arrive O
at O
the O
little O
flag O
station O
known O
as O
College O
Park O
. O
This O
man O
talked O
with O
Manuel O
, O
and O
money O
chinked O
between O
them O
. O
`` O
You O
might O
wrap O
up O
the O
goods O
before O
you O
deliver O
'm O
, O
'' O
the O
stranger O
said O
gruffly O
, O
and O
Manuel I-PERSON
doubled O
a O
piece O
of O
stout O
rope O
around O
Buck I-PERSON
's O
neck O
under O
the O
collar O
. O
`` O
Twist O
it O
, O
an O
' O
you O
'll O
choke O
'm O
plentee O
, O
'' O
said O
Manuel I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
stranger O
grunted O
a O
ready O
affirmative O
. O
Buck I-PERSON
had O
accepted O
the O
rope O
with O
quiet O
dignity O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
was O
an O
unwonted O
performance O
: O
but O
he O
had O
learned O
to O
trust O
in O
men O
he O
knew O
, O
and O
to O
give O
them O
credit O
for O
a O
wisdom O
that O
outreached O
his O
own O
. O
But O
when O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
rope O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
stranger O
's O
hands O
, O
he O
growled O
menacingly O
. O
He O
had O
merely O
intimated O
his O
displeasure O
, O
in O
his O
pride O
believing O
that O
to O
intimate O
was O
to O
command O
. O
But O
to O
his O
surprise O
the O
rope O
tightened O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
shutting O
off O
his O
breath O
. O
In O
quick O
rage O
he O
sprang O
at O
the O
man O
, O
who O
met O
him O
halfway O
, O
grappled O
him O
close O
by O
the O
throat O
, O
and O
with O
a O
deft O
twist O
threw O
him O
over O
on O
his O
back O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
tightened O
mercilessly O
, O
while O
Buck I-PERSON
struggled O
in O
a O
fury O
, O
his O
tongue O
lolling O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
his O
great O
chest O
panting O
futilely O
. O
Never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
vilely O
treated O
, O
and O
never O
in O
all O
his O
life O
had O
he O
been O
so O
angry O
. O
But O
his O
strength O
ebbed O
, O
his O
eyes O
glazed O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
nothing O
when O
the O
train O
was O
flagged O
and O
the O
two O
men O
threw O
him O
into O
the O
baggage O
car O
. O
The O
next O
he O
knew O
, O
he O
was O
dimly O
aware O
that O
his O
tongue O
was O
hurting O
and O
that O
he O
was O
being O
jolted O
along O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
a O
conveyance O
. O
The O
hoarse O
shriek O
of O
a O
locomotive O
whistling O
a O
crossing O
told O
him O
where O
he O
was O
. O
He O
had O
travelled O
too O
often O
with O
the O
Judge O
not O
to O
know O
the O
sensation O
of O
riding O
in O
a O
baggage O
car O
. O
He O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
into O
them O
came O
the O
unbridled O
anger O
of O
a O
kidnapped O
king O
. O
The O
man O
sprang O
for O
his O
throat O
, O
but O
Buck I-PERSON
was O
too O
quick O
for O
him O
. O
His O
jaws O
closed O
on O
the O
hand O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
relax O
till O
his O
senses O
were O
choked O
out O
of O
him O
once O
more O
. O
`` O
Yep O
, O
has O
fits O
, O
'' O
the O
man O
said O
, O
hiding O
his O
mangled O
hand O
from O
the O
baggageman O
, O
who O
had O
been O
attracted O
by O
the O
sounds O
of O
struggle O
. O
`` O
I O

that O
he O
can O
cure O

'' O
Concerning O
that O
night O
's O
ride O
, O
the O
man O
spoke O
most O
eloquently O
for O
himself O
, O
in O
a O
little O
shed O
back O
of O
a O
saloon O
on O
the O
San O
Francisco O
water O
front O
. O
`` O
All O
I O
get O
is O
fifty O
for O
it O
, O
'' O
he O
grumbled O
; O
`` O
an O
' O
I O
would O
n't O
do O
it O
over O
for O
a O
thousand O

cold O

'' O
His O
hand O
was O
wrapped O
in O
a O
bloody O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
the O
right O
trouser O
leg O
was O
ripped O
from O
knee O
to O
ankle O
. O
`` O
How O
much O
did O
the O
other O
mug O
get O
? O
'' O
the O
saloon O
- O
keeper O
demanded O
. O
`` O
A O
hundred O

'' O
was O
the O
reply O
. O
`` O
Would O

take O
a O
sou O
less O

so O

me O

'' O
`` O
That O
makes O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
, O
'' O
the O
saloon O

keeper O
calculated O
; O
`` O
and O
he O
's O
worth O
it O

I O

a O
squarehead O

'' O
The O
kidnapper O
undid O
the O
bloody O
wrappings O

looked O
at O
his O
lacerated O
hand O

`` O
If O
I O
do O

get O
the O
hydrophoby O

'' O
`` O
It O

be O
because O

laughed O
the O
saloon O

keeper O
. O
`` O
Here O
, O
lend O
me O
a O
hand O
before O
you O
pull O
your O

he O
added O
. O
Dazed O
, O
suffering O
intolerable O
pain O
from O
throat O
and O
tongue O
, O
with O
the O
life O
half O
throttled O
out O
of O
him O
, O
Buck I-PERSON
attempted O
to O
face O
his O
tormentors O
. O
But O
he O
was O
thrown O
down O
and O
choked O
repeatedly O
, O
till O
they O
succeeded O
in O
filing O
the O
heavy O
brass O
collar O
from O
off O
his O
neck O
. O
Then O
the O
rope O
was O
removed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
flung O
into O
a O
cagelike O
crate O
. O
There O
he O
lay O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
weary O
night O
, O
nursing O
his O
wrath O
and O
wounded O
pride O
. O
He O
could O
not O
understand O
what O
it O
all O
meant O
. O
What O
did O
they O
want O
with O
him O
, O
these O
strange O
men O
? O
Why O
were O
they O
keeping O
him O
pent O
up O
in O
this O
narrow O
crate O
? O
He O
did O
not O
know O
why O
, O
but O
he O
felt O
oppressed O
by O
the O
vague O
sense O
of O
impending O
calamity O
. O
Several O
times O
during O
the O
night O
he O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
when O
the O
shed O
door O
rattled O
open O
, O
expecting O
to O
see O
the O
Judge O
, O
or O
the O
boys O
at O
least O
. O
But O
each O
time O
it O
was O
the O
bulging O
face O
of O
the O
saloon O
- O
keeper O
that O
peered O
in O
at O
him O
by O
the O
sickly O
light O
of O
a O
tallow O
candle O
. O
And O
each O
time O
the O
joyful O
bark O
that O
trembled O
in O
Buck I-PERSON
's O
throat O
was O
twisted O
into O
a O
savage O
growl O
. O
But O
the O
saloon O
- O
keeper O
let O
him O
alone O
, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
four O
men O
entered O
and O
picked O
up O
the O
crate O
. O
More O
tormentors O
, O
Buck I-PERSON
decided O
, O
for O
they O
were O
evil O
- O
looking O
creatures O
, O
ragged O
and O
unkempt O
; O
and O
he O
stormed O
and O
raged O
at O
them O
through O
the O
bars O
. O
They O
only O
laughed O
and O
poked O
sticks O
at O
him O
, O
which O
he O
promptly O
assailed O
with O
his O
teeth O
till O
he O
realized O
that O
that O
was O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O
Whereupon O
he O
lay O
down O
sullenly O
and O
allowed O
the O
crate O
to O
be O
lifted O
into O
a O
wagon O
. O
Then O
he O
, O
and O
the O
crate O
in O
which O
he O
was O
imprisoned O
, O
began O
a O
passage O
through O
many O
hands O
. O
Clerks O
in O
the O
express O
office O
took O
charge O
of O
him O
; O
he O
was O
carted O
about O
in O
another O
wagon O
; O
a O
truck O
carried O
him O
, O
with O
an O
assortment O
of O
boxes O
and O
parcels O
, O
upon O
a O
ferry O
steamer O

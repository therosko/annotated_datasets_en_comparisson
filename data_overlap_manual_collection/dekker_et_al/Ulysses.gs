Stephen I-PERSON

bent O
towards O
him O

gurgling O
in O
his O

Stephen I-PERSON
Dedalus I-PERSON
, O
displeased O

coldly O
at O

then O
covered O
the O

smartly O
. O
-- O
Back O

He O
added O
in O
a O

He O
peered O
sideways O
up O
and O
gave O
a O
long O
slow O
whistle O
of O
call O
, O
then O
paused O
awhile O
in O
rapt O
attention O
, O
his O
even O
white O

there O
with O

He O
skipped O
off O

looked O
gravely O
at O
his O
watcher O
, O
gathering O
about O
his O
legs O
the O
loose O
folds O
of O
his O
gown O
. O
The O
plump O
shadowed O

sullen O

recalled O
a O

A O
pleasant O

broke O
quietly O
over O

Stephen I-PERSON

down O
on O

Buck I-PERSON

frowned O
at O
the O

on O
his O

. O
He O
hopped O
down O
from O
his O

and O
began O
to O
search O

hastily O
. O
-- O
Scutter O

he O
cried O
thickly O
. O
He O
came O
over O
to O
the O

, O
thrusting O
a O

into O
Stephen I-PERSON

over O

looked O
down O
on O

on O

He O
turned O
abruptly O
his O
grey O
searching O
eyes O
from O
the O
sea O
to O
Stephen I-PERSON

face O
. O
-- O
The O

Kinch I-PERSON
, O
when O
your O

Buck I-PERSON
Mulligan I-PERSON
said O
. O
I O
'm O
hyperborean O
as O

... O
He O
broke O
off O
and O
lathered O
again O
lightly O
his O
farther O
cheek O
. O
A O
tolerant O
smile O
curled O
his O
lips O
. O
-- O
But O
a O

he O
murmured O
to O
himself O

Kinch I-PERSON

He O
shaved O
evenly O

in O
silence O
, O
seriously O
. O
Stephen I-PERSON
, O
an O
elbow O
rested O
on O
the O
jagged O
granite O
, O
leaned O
his O
palm O
against O
his O
brow O
and O
gazed O
at O
the O
fraying O
edge O
of O
his O
shiny O
black O
coat O

Pain O
, O
that O

Silently O
, O
in O
a O
dream O
she O
had O
come O
to O
him O
after O
her O
death O
, O
her O
wasted O
body O
within O
its O
loose O
brown O
graveclothes O
giving O
off O
an O
odour O
of O

, O
her O
breath O
, O
that O

bent O
upon O
him O

Across O

by O
the O

beside O
him O
. O
The O
ring O
of O

held O
a O
dull O
green O
mass O
of O
liquid O
. O
A O
bowl O
of O

had O
stood O
beside O
her O

holding O
the O
green O
sluggish O

up O
from O

Stephen O

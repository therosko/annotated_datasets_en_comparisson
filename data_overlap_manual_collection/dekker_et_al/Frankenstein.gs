I O
arrived O
here O
yesterday O
, O
and O
my O
first O
task O
is O
to O
assure O
my O
dear O
sister O
of O
my O
welfare O
and O
increasing O
confidence O
in O
the O
success O
of O
my O
undertaking O
. O
I O
am O
already O
far O
north O
of O
London O
, O
and O
as O
I O
walk O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Petersburgh O
, O
I O
feel O
a O
cold O
northern O
breeze O
play O
upon O
my O
cheeks O
, O
which O
braces O
my O
nerves O
and O
fills O
me O
with O
delight O
. O
Do O
you O
understand O
this O
feeling O
? O
This O
breeze O
, O
which O
has O
travelled O
from O
the O
regions O
towards O
which O
I O
am O
advancing O
, O
gives O
me O
a O
foretaste O
of O
those O
icy O
climes O
. O
Inspirited O
by O
this O
wind O
of O
promise O
, O
my O
daydreams O
become O
more O
fervent O
and O
vivid O
. O
I O
try O
in O
vain O
to O
be O
persuaded O
that O
the O
pole O
is O
the O
seat O
of O
frost O
and O
desolation O
; O
it O
ever O
presents O
itself O
to O
my O
imagination O
as O
the O
region O
of O
beauty O
and O
delight O
. O
There O
, O
Margaret I-PERSON
, O
the O
sun O
is O
forever O
visible O
, O
its O
broad O
disk O
just O
skirting O
the O
horizon O
and O
diffusing O
a O
perpetual O
splendour O
. O
There O
-- O
for O
with O
your O
leave O
, O
my O
sister O
, O
I O
will O
put O
some O
trust O
in O
preceding O
navigators O
-- O
there O
snow O
and O
frost O
are O
banished O
; O
and O
, O
sailing O
over O
a O
calm O
sea O
, O
we O
may O
be O
wafted O
to O
a O
land O
surpassing O
in O
wonders O
and O
in O
beauty O
every O
region O
hitherto O
discovered O
on O
the O
habitable O
globe O
. O
Its O
productions O
and O
features O
may O
be O
without O
example O
, O
as O
the O
phenomena O
of O
the O
heavenly O
bodies O
undoubtedly O
are O
in O
those O
undiscovered O
solitudes O
. O
What O
may O
not O
be O
expected O
in O
a O
country O
of O
eternal O
light O
? O
I O
may O
there O
discover O
the O
wondrous O
power O
which O
attracts O
the O
needle O
and O
may O
regulate O
a O
thousand O
celestial O
observations O
that O
require O
only O
this O
voyage O
to O
render O
their O
seeming O
eccentricities O
consistent O
forever O
. O
I O
shall O
satiate O
my O
ardent O
curiosity O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
world O
never O
before O
visited O
, O
and O
may O
tread O
a O
land O
never O
before O
imprinted O
by O
the O
foot O
of O
man O
. O
These O
are O
my O
enticements O
, O
and O
they O
are O
sufficient O
to O
conquer O
all O
fear O
of O
danger O
or O
death O
and O
to O
induce O
me O
to O
commence O
this O
laborious O
voyage O
with O
the O
joy O
a O
child O
feels O
when O
he O
embarks O
in O
a O
little O
boat O
, O
with O
his O
holiday O
mates O
, O
on O
an O
expedition O
of O
discovery O
up O
his O
native O
river O
. O
But O
supposing O
all O
these O
conjectures O
to O
be O
false O
, O
you O
can O
not O
contest O
the O
inestimable O
benefit O
which O
I O
shall O
confer O
on O
all O
mankind O
, O
to O
the O
last O
generation O
, O
by O
discovering O
a O
passage O
near O
the O
pole O
to O
those O
countries O
, O
to O
reach O
which O
at O
present O
so O
many O
months O
are O
requisite O
; O
or O
by O
ascertaining O
the O
secret O
of O
the O
magnet O
, O
which O
, O
if O
at O
all O
possible O
, O
can O
only O
be O
effected O
by O
an O
undertaking O
such O
as O
mine O
. O
These O
reflections O
have O
dispelled O
the O
agitation O
with O
which O
I O
began O
my O
letter O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
my O
heart O
glow O
with O
an O
enthusiasm O
which O
elevates O
me O
to O
heaven O
, O
for O
nothing O
contributes O
so O
much O
to O
tranquillize O
the O
mind O
as O
a O
steady O
purpose O
-- O
a O
point O
on O
which O
the O
soul O
may O
fix O
its O
intellectual O
eye O
. O
This O
expedition O
has O
been O
the O
favourite O
dream O
of O
my O
early O
years O
. O
I O
have O
read O
with O
ardour O
the O
accounts O
of O
the O
various O
voyages O
which O
have O
been O
made O
in O
the O
prospect O
of O
arriving O
at O
the O
North O
Pacific O
Ocean O
through O
the O
seas O
which O
surround O
the O
pole O
. O
You O
may O
remember O
that O
a O
history O
of O
all O
the O
voyages O
made O
for O
purposes O
of O
discovery O
composed O
the O
whole O
of O
our O
good O
Uncle O
Thomas O
' O
library O
. O
My O
education O
was O
neglected O
, O
yet O
I O
was O
passionately O
fond O
of O
reading O
. O
These O
volumes O
were O
my O
study O
day O
and O
night O
, O
and O
my O
familiarity O
with O
them O
increased O
that O
regret O
which O
I O
had O
felt O
, O
as O
a O
child O
, O
on O
learning O
that O
my O
father O
's O
dying O
injunction O
had O
forbidden O
my O
uncle O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
embark O
in O
a O
seafaring O
life O
. O
These O
visions O
faded O
when O
I O
perused O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
those O
poets O
whose O
effusions O
entranced O
my O
soul O
and O
lifted O
it O
to O
heaven O
. O
I O
also O
became O
a O
poet O
and O
for O
one O
year O
lived O
in O
a O
paradise O
of O
my O
own O
creation O
; O
I O
imagined O
that O
I O
also O
might O
obtain O
a O
niche O
in O
the O
temple O
where O
the O
names O
of O
Homer O
and O
Shakespeare O
are O
consecrated O
. O
You O
are O
well O
acquainted O
with O
my O
failure O
and O
how O
heavily O
I O
bore O
the O
disappointment O
. O
But O
just O
at O
that O
time O
I O
inherited O
the O
fortune O
of O
my O
cousin O
, O
and O
my O
thoughts O
were O
turned O
into O
the O
channel O
of O
their O
earlier O
bent O
. O
Six O
years O
have O
passed O
since O
I O
resolved O
on O
my O
present O
undertaking O
. O
I O
can O
, O
even O
now O
, O
remember O
the O
hour O
from O
which O
I O
dedicated O
myself O
to O
this O
great O
enterprise O
. O
I O
commenced O
by O
inuring O
my O
body O
to O
hardship O
. O
I O
accompanied O
the O
whale O
- O
fishers O
on O
several O
expeditions O
to O
the O
North O
Sea O
; O
I O
voluntarily O
endured O
cold O
, O
famine O
, O
thirst O
, O
and O
want O
of O
sleep O
; O
I O
often O
worked O
harder O
than O
the O
common O
sailors O
during O
the O
day O
and O
devoted O
my O
nights O
to O
the O
study O
of O
mathematics O
, O
the O
theory O
of O
medicine O
, O
and O
those O
branches O
of O
physical O
science O
from O
which O
a O
naval O
adventurer O
might O
derive O
the O
greatest O
practical O
advantage O
. O
Twice O
I O
actually O
hired O
myself O
as O
an O
under O
- O
mate O
in O
a O
Greenland O
whaler O
, O
and O
acquitted O
myself O
to O
admiration O
. O
I O
must O
own O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
proud O
when O
my O
captain O
offered O
me O
the O
second O
dignity O
in O
the O
vessel O
and O
entreated O
me O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
greatest O
earnestness O
, O
so O
valuable O
did O
he O
consider O
my O
services O
. O
And O
now O
, O
dear O
Margaret I-PERSON
, O
do O
I O
not O
deserve O
to O
accomplish O
some O
great O
purpose O
? O
My O
life O
might O
have O
been O
passed O
in O
ease O
and O
luxury O
, O
but O
I O
preferred O
glory O
to O
every O
enticement O
that O
wealth O
placed O
in O
my O
path O
. O
Oh O
, O
that O
some O
encouraging O
voice O
would O
answer O
in O
the O
affirmative O
! O
My O
courage O
and O
my O
resolution O
is O
firm O
; O
but O
my O
hopes O
fluctuate O
, O
and O
my O
spirits O
are O
often O
depressed O
. O
I O
am O
about O
to O
proceed O
on O
a O
long O
and O
difficult O
voyage O
, O
the O
emergencies O
of O
which O
will O
demand O
all O
my O
fortitude O
: O
I O
am O
required O
not O
only O
to O
raise O
the O
spirits O
of O
others O
, O
but O
sometimes O
to O
sustain O
my O
own O
, O
when O
theirs O
are O
failing O
. O
This O
is O
the O
most O
favourable O
period O
for O
travelling O
in O
Russia O
. O
They O
fly O
quickly O
over O
the O
snow O
in O
their O
sledges O
; O
the O
motion O
is O
pleasant O
, O
and O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
far O
more O
agreeable O
than O
that O
of O
an O
English O
stagecoach O
. O
The O
cold O
is O
not O
excessive O
, O
if O
you O
are O
wrapped O
in O
furs O
-- O
a O
dress O
which O
I O
have O
already O
adopted O
, O
for O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference O
between O
walking O
the O
deck O
and O
remaining O
seated O
motionless O
for O
hours O
, O
when O
no O
exercise O
prevents O
the O
blood O
from O
actually O
freezing O
in O
your O
veins O
. O
I O
have O
no O
ambition O
to O
lose O
my O
life O
on O
the O
post O
- O
road O
between O
St. O
Petersburgh O
and O
Archangel O
. O
I O
shall O
depart O
for O
the O
latter O
town O
in O
a O
fortnight O
or O
three O
weeks O
; O
and O
my O
intention O
is O
to O
hire O
a O
ship O
there O
, O
which O
can O
easily O
be O
done O
by O
paying O
the O
insurance O
for O
the O
owner O
, O
and O
to O
engage O
as O
many O
sailors O
as O
I O
think O
necessary O
among O
those O
who O
are O
accustomed O
to O
the O
whale O
- O
fishing O
. O
I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
sail O
until O
the O
month O
of O
June O
; O
and O
when O
shall O
I O
return O
? O
Ah O
, O
dear O
sister O
, O
how O
can O
I O
answer O
this O
question O
? O
If O
I O
succeed O
, O
many O
, O
many O
months O
, O
perhaps O
years O
, O
will O
pass O
before O
you O
and O
I O
may O
meet O
. O
If O
I O
fail O
, O
you O
will O
see O
me O
again O
soon O
, O
or O
never O
. O
Farewell O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
excellent O
Margaret O
. O
Heaven O
shower O
down O
blessings O
on O
you O
, O
and O
save O
me O
, O
that O
I O
may O
again O
and O
again O
testify O
my O
gratitude O
for O
all O
your O
love O
and O
kindness O

-- O
To O
Mrs. I-PERSON
Saville I-PERSON
, O
England O
How O
slowly O
the O
time O
passes O
here O
, O
encompassed O
as O
I O
am O
by O
frost O
and O
snow O
! O
Yet O
a O
second O
step O
is O
taken O
towards O
my O
enterprise O
. O
I O
have O
hired O
a O
vessel O
and O
am O
occupied O
in O
collecting O
my O
sailors O
; O
those O
whom O
I O
have O
already O
engaged O
appear O
to O
be O
men O
on O
whom O
I O
can O
depend O
and O
are O
certainly O
possessed O
of O
dauntless O
courage O
. O
But O
I O
have O
one O
want O
which O
I O
have O
never O
yet O
been O
able O
to O
satisfy O
, O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
object O
of O
which O
I O
now O
feel O
as O
a O
most O
severe O
evil O
, O
I O
have O
no O
friend O
, O
Margaret O
: O
when O
I O
am O
glowing O
with O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
success O
, O
there O
will O
be O
none O
to O
participate O
my O
joy O
; O
if O
I O
am O
assailed O
by O
disappointment O
, O
no O
one O
will O
endeavour O
to O
sustain O
me O
in O
dejection O
. O
I O
shall O
commit O
my O
thoughts O
to O
paper O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
that O
is O
a O
poor O
medium O
for O
the O
communication O
of O
feeling O
. O
I O
desire O
the O
company O
of O
a O
man O
who O
could O
sympathize O
with O
me O
, O
whose O
eyes O
would O
reply O
to O
mine O
. O
You O
may O
deem O
me O
romantic O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
but O
I O
bitterly O
feel O
the O
want O
of O
a O
friend O
. O
I O
have O
no O
one O
near O
me O
, O
gentle O
yet O
courageous O
, O
possessed O
of O
a O
cultivated O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
capacious O
mind O
, O
whose O
tastes O
are O
like O
my O
own O
, O
to O
approve O
or O
amend O
my O
plans O
. O
How O
would O
such O
a O
friend O
repair O
the O
faults O
of O
your O
poor O
brother O
! O
I O
am O
too O
ardent O
in O
execution O
and O
too O
impatient O
of O
difficulties O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
still O
greater O
evil O
to O
me O
that O
I O
am O
self O
- O
educated O
: O
for O
the O
first O
fourteen O
years O
of O
my O
life O
I O
ran O
wild O
on O
a O
common O
and O
read O
nothing O
but O
our O
Uncle O
Thomas O
' O
books O
of O
voyages O
. O
At O
that O
age O
I O
became O
acquainted O
with O
the O
celebrated O
poets O
of O
our O
own O
country O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
when O
it O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
derive O
its O
most O
important O
benefits O
from O
such O
a O
conviction O
that O
I O
perceived O
the O
necessity O
of O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
more O
languages O
than O
that O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
twenty O
- O
eight O
and O
am O
in O
reality O
more O
illiterate O
than O
many O
schoolboys O
of O
fifteen O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
have O
thought O
more O
and O
that O
my O
daydreams O
are O
more O
extended O
and O
magnificent O
, O
but O
they O
want O
-LRB- O
as O
the O
painters O
call O
it O
-RRB- O
KEEPING O
; O
and O
I O
greatly O
need O
a O
friend O
who O
would O
have O
sense O
enough O
not O
to O
despise O
me O
as O
romantic O
, O
and O
affection O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
endeavour O
to O
regulate O
my O
mind O
. O
Well O
, O
these O
are O
useless O
complaints O
; O
I O
shall O
certainly O
find O
no O
friend O
on O
the O
wide O
ocean O
, O
nor O
even O
here O
in O
Archangel O
, O
among O
merchants O
and O
seamen O
. O
Yet O
some O
feelings O
, O
unallied O
to O
the O
dross O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
beat O
even O
in O
these O
rugged O
bosoms O
. O
My O
lieutenant O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
a O
man O
of O
wonderful O
courage O
and O
enterprise O
; O
he O
is O
madly O
desirous O
of O
glory O
, O
or O
rather O
, O
to O
word O
my O
phrase O
more O
characteristically O
, O
of O
advancement O
in O
his O
profession O
. O
He O
is O
an O
Englishman O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
national O
and O
professional O
prejudices O
, O
unsoftened O
by O
cultivation O
, O
retains O
some O
of O
the O
noblest O
endowments O
of O
humanity O
. O
I O
first O
became O
acquainted O
with O
him O
on O
board O
a O
whale O
vessel O
; O
finding O
that O
he O
was O
unemployed O
in O
this O
city O
, O
I O
easily O
engaged O
him O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
enterprise O
. O
The O
master O
is O
a O
person O
of O
an O
excellent O
disposition O
and O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the O
ship O
for O
his O
gentleness O
and O
the O
mildness O
of O
his O
discipline O
. O
This O
circumstance O
, O
added O
to O
his O
well O
- O
known O
integrity O
and O
dauntless O
courage O
, O
made O
me O
very O
desirous O
to O
engage O
him O
. O
A O
youth O
passed O
in O
solitude O
, O
my O
best O
years O
spent O
under O
your O
gentle O
and O
feminine O
fosterage O
, O
has O
so O
refined O
the O
groundwork O
of O
my O
character O
that O
I O
can O
not O
overcome O
an O
intense O
distaste O
to O
the O
usual O
brutality O
exercised O
on O
board O
ship O
: O
I O
have O
never O
believed O
it O
to O
be O
necessary O
, O
and O
when O
I O
heard O
of O
a O
mariner O
equally O
noted O
for O
his O
kindliness O
of O
heart O
and O
the O
respect O
and O
obedience O
paid O
to O
him O
by O
his O
crew O
, O
I O
felt O
myself O
peculiarly O
fortunate O
in O
being O
able O
to O
secure O
his O
services O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
him O
first O
in O
rather O
a O
romantic O
manner O
, O
from O
a O
lady O
who O
owes O
to O
him O
the O
happiness O
of O
her O
life O
. O
This O
, O
briefly O
, O
is O
his O
story O
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
he O
loved O
a O
young O
Russian O
lady O
of O
moderate O
fortune O
, O
and O
having O
amassed O
a O
considerable O
sum O
in O
prize O
- O
money O
, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
girl O
consented O
to O
the O
match O
. O
He O
saw O
his O
mistress O
once O
before O
the O
destined O
ceremony O
; O
but O
she O
was O
bathed O
in O
tears O
, O
and O
throwing O
herself O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
entreated O
him O
to O
spare O
her O
, O
confessing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
loved O
another O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
poor O
, O
and O
that O
her O
father O
would O
never O
consent O
to O
the O
union O
. O
My O
generous O
friend O
reassured O
the O
suppliant O
, O
and O
on O
being O
informed O
of O
the O
name O
of O
her O
lover O
, O
instantly O
abandoned O
his O
pursuit O
. O
He O
had O
already O
bought O
a O
farm O
with O
his O
money O
, O
on O
which O
he O
had O
designed O
to O
pass O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
; O
but O
he O
bestowed O
the O
whole O
on O
his O
rival O
, O
together O
with O
the O
remains O
of O
his O
prize O
- O
money O
to O
purchase O
stock O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
solicited O
the O
young O
woman O
's O
father O
to O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
with O
her O
lover O
. O
But O
the O
old O
man O
decidedly O
refused O
, O
thinking O
himself O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
my O
friend O
, O
who O
, O
when O
he O
found O
the O
father O
inexorable O
, O
quitted O
his O
country O
, O
nor O
returned O
until O
he O
heard O
that O
his O
former O
mistress O
was O
married O
according O
to O
her O
inclinations O
. O
` O
What O
a O
noble O
fellow O
! O
' O
you O
will O
exclaim O
. O
He O
is O
so O
; O
but O
then O
he O
is O
wholly O
uneducated O
: O
he O
is O
as O
silent O
as O
a O
Turk O
, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
ignorant O
carelessness O
attends O
him O
, O
which O
, O
while O
it O
renders O
his O
conduct O
the O
more O
astonishing O
, O
detracts O
from O
the O
interest O
and O
sympathy O
which O
otherwise O
he O
would O
command O
. O

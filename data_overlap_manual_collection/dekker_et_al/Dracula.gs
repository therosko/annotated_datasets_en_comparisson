Buda O
- O
Pesth O
seems O
a O
wonderful O
place O
, O
from O
the O
glimpse O
which O
I O
got O
of O
it O
from O
the O
train O
and O
the O
little O
I O
could O
walk O
through O
the O
streets O
. O
I O
feared O
to O
go O
very O
far O
from O
the O
station O
, O
as O
we O
had O
arrived O
late O
and O
would O
start O
as O
near O
the O
correct O
time O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
impression O
I O
had O
was O
that O
we O
were O
leaving O
the O
West O
and O
entering O
the O
East O
; O
the O
most O
western O
of O
splendid O
bridges O
over O
the O
Danube O
, O
which O
is O
here O
of O
noble O
width O
and O
depth O
, O
took O
us O
among O
the O
traditions O
of O
Turkish O
rule O
. O
We O
left O
in O
pretty O
good O
time O
, O
and O
came O
after O
nightfall O
to O
Klausenburgh O
. O
Here O
I O
stopped O
for O
the O
night O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Royale O
. O
I O
had O
for O
dinner O
, O
or O
rather O
supper O
, O
a O
chicken O
done O
up O
some O
way O
with O
red O
pepper O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
but O
thirsty O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waiter O
, O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
called O
` O
paprika O
hendl O
, O
' O
and O
that O
, O
as O
it O
was O
a O
national O
dish O
, O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
it O
anywhere O
along O
the O
Carpathians O
. O
I O
found O
my O
smattering O
of O
German O
very O
useful O
here O
; O
indeed O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
on O
without O
it O

Having O
had O
some O
time O
at O
my O
disposal O
when O
in O
London O
, O
I O
had O
visited O
the O
British O
Museum O
, O
and O
made O
search O
among O
the O
books O
and O
maps O
in O
the O
library O
regarding O
Transylvania O
; O
it O
had O
struck O
me O
that O
some O
foreknowledge O
of O
the O
country O
could O
hardly O
fail O
to O
have O
some O
importance O
in O
dealing O
with O
a O
nobleman O
of O
that O
country O
. O
I O
find O
that O
the O
district O
he O
named O
is O
in O
the O
extreme O
east O
of O
the O
country O
, O
just O
on O
the O
borders O
of O
three O
states O
, O
Transylvania O
, O
Moldavia O
and O
Bukovina O
, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
Carpathian O
mountains O
; O
one O
of O
the O
wildest O
and O
least O
known O
portions O
of O
Europe O
. O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
light O
on O
any O
map O
or O
work O
giving O
the O
exact O
locality O
of O
the O
Castle O
Dracula O
, O
as O
there O
are O
no O
maps O
of O
this O
country O
as O
yet O
to O
compare O
with O
our O
own O
Ordnance O
Survey O
maps O
; O
but O
I O
found O
that O
Bistritz O
, O
the O
post O
town O
named O
by O
Count O
Dracula O
, O
is O
a O
fairly O
well O
- O
known O
place O
. O
I O
shall O
enter O
here O
some O
of O
my O
notes O
, O
as O
they O
may O
refresh O
my O
memory O
when O
I O
talk O
over O
my O
travels O
with O
Mina O
. O
In O
the O
population O
of O
Transylvania O
there O
are O
four O
distinct O
nationalities O
: O
Saxons O
in O
the O
South O
, O
and O
mixed O
with O
them O
the O
Wallachs O
, O
who O
are O
the O
descendants O
of O
the O
Dacians O
; O
Magyars O
in O
the O
West O
, O
and O
Szekelys O
in O
the O
East O
and O
North O
. O
I O
am O
going O
among O
the O
latter O
, O
who O
claim O
to O
be O
descended O
from O
Attila O
and O
the O
Huns O
. O
This O
may O
be O
so O
, O
for O
when O
the O
Magyars O
conquered O
the O
country O
in O
the O
eleventh O
century O
they O
found O
the O
Huns O
settled O
in O
it O
. O
I O
read O
that O
every O
known O
superstition O
in O
the O
world O
is O
gathered O
into O
the O
horseshoe O
of O
the O
Carpathians O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
centre O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
imaginative O
whirlpool O

so O
my O

may O

I O
did O
not O
sleep O
well O
, O
though O
my O
bed O
was O
comfortable O
enough O
, O
for O
I O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
queer O
dreams O
. O
There O
was O
a O
dog O
howling O
all O
night O
under O
my O
window O
, O
which O
may O
have O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
; O
or O
it O
may O
have O
been O
the O
paprika O

for O
I O
had O
to O
drink O
up O
all O
the O
water O
in O
my O
carafe O
, O
and O
was O
still O
thirsty O
. O
Towards O
morning O
I O
slept O
and O
was O
wakened O
by O
the O
continuous O
knocking O
at O
my O
door O
, O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
must O
have O
been O
sleeping O
soundly O
then O
. O
I O
had O
for O
breakfast O
more O
paprika O

and O
a O
sort O
of O
porridge O
of O

they O
said O
was O

I O
had O
to O
hurry O
breakfast O
, O
for O
the O
train O
started O
a O
little O
before O
eight O
, O
or O
rather O
it O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
, O
for O
after O
rushing O
to O
the O
station O
at O
7:30 O
I O
had O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
carriage O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
before O
we O
began O
to O
move O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
further O
east O
you O
go O
the O
more O
unpunctual O
are O
the O
trains O
. O
What O
ought O
they O
to O
be O
in O
China O
? O
All O
day O
long O
we O
seemed O
to O
dawdle O
through O
a O
country O
which O
was O
full O
of O
beauty O
of O
every O
kind O
. O
Sometimes O
we O
saw O
little O
towns O
or O
castles O
on O
the O
top O
of O
steep O
hills O
such O
as O
we O
see O
in O
old O
missals O
; O
sometimes O
we O
ran O
by O
rivers O
and O
streams O
which O
seemed O
from O
the O
wide O
stony O
margin O
on O
each O
side O
of O
them O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
great O
floods O
. O
It O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
, O
and O
running O
strong O
, O
to O
sweep O
the O
outside O
edge O
of O
a O
river O
clear O
. O
At O
every O
station O
there O
were O
groups O
of O
people O
, O
sometimes O
crowds O
, O
and O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
attire O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
were O
just O
like O
the O
peasants O
at O
home O
or O
those O
I O
saw O
coming O
through O
France O
and O
Germany O
, O
with O
short O
jackets O
and O
round O
hats O
and O
home O
- O
made O
trousers O
; O
but O
others O
were O
very O
picturesque O
. O
The O
women O
looked O
pretty O
, O
except O
when O
you O
got O
near O
them O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
clumsy O
about O
the O
waist O
. O
They O
had O
all O
full O
white O
sleeves O
of O
some O
kind O
or O
other O
, O
and O
most O
of O
them O
had O
big O
belts O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
strips O
of O
something O
fluttering O
from O
them O
like O
the O
dresses O
in O
a O
ballet O
, O
but O
of O
course O
there O
were O
petticoats O
under O
them O
. O
The O
strangest O
figures O
we O
saw O
were O
the O
Slovaks O
, O
who O
were O
more O
barbarian O
than O
the O
rest O
, O
with O
their O
big O
cow O
- O
boy O
hats O
, O
great O
baggy O
dirty O
- O
white O
trousers O
, O
white O
linen O
shirts O
, O
and O
enormous O
heavy O
leather O
belts O
, O
nearly O
a O
foot O
wide O
, O
all O
studded O
over O
with O
brass O
nails O
. O
They O
wore O
high O
boots O
, O
with O
their O
trousers O
tucked O
into O
them O
, O
and O
had O
long O
black O
hair O
and O
heavy O
black O
moustaches O
. O
They O
are O
very O
picturesque O
, O
but O
do O
not O
look O
prepossessing O
. O
On O
the O
stage O
they O
would O
be O
set O
down O
at O
once O
as O
some O
old O
Oriental O
band O
of O
brigands O
. O
They O
are O
, O
however O
, O
I O
am O
told O
, O
very O
harmless O
and O
rather O
wanting O
in O
natural O
self O
- O
assertion O
. O
It O
was O
on O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
twilight O
when O
we O
got O
to O
Bistritz O
, O
which O
is O
a O
very O
interesting O
old O
place O
. O
Being O
practically O
on O
the O
frontier O
-- O
for O
the O
Borgo O
Pass O
leads O
from O
it O
into O
Bukovina O
-- O
it O
has O
had O
a O
very O
stormy O
existence O
, O
and O
it O
certainly O
shows O
marks O
of O
it O
. O
Fifty O
years O
ago O
a O
series O
of O
great O
fires O
took O
place O
, O
which O
made O
terrible O
havoc O
on O
five O
separate O
occasions O
. O
At O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
seventeenth O
century O
it O
underwent O
a O
siege O
of O
three O
weeks O
and O
lost O
13,000 O
people O
, O
the O
casualties O
of O
war O
proper O
being O
assisted O
by O
famine O
and O
disease O
. O
Count I-PERSON
Dracula I-PERSON
had O
directed O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Golden O
Krone O
Hotel O
, O
which O
I O
found O
, O
to O
my O
great O
delight O
, O
to O
be O
thoroughly O
old O
- O
fashioned O
, O
for O
of O
course O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
all O
I O
could O
of O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
country O
. O
I O
was O
evidently O
expected O
, O
for O
when O
I O
got O
near O
the O
door O
I O
faced O
a O
cheery O
- O
looking O
elderly O
woman O
in O
the O
usual O
peasant O
dress O
-- O
white O
undergarment O
with O
long O
double O
apron O
, O
front O
, O
and O
back O
, O
of O
coloured O
stuff O
fitting O
almost O
too O
tight O
for O
modesty O
. O
When O
I O
came O
close O
she O
bowed O
and O
said O
, O
` O
The O
Herr O
Englishman O
? O
' O
` O
Yes O
, O

I O
said O
, O
` O
Jonathan O

She O
smiled O
, O
and O
gave O
some O
message O
to O
an O
elderly O
man O
in O
white O
shirt O
- O
sleeves O
, O
who O
had O
followed O
her O
to O
the O
door O
. O
He O
went O
, O
but O
immediately O
returned O
with O
a O
letter O
: O

At O
the O

my O

-- O
I O
found O
that O
my O
landlord O
had O
got O
a O
letter O
from O
the O
Count I-PERSON
, O
directing O
him O
to O
secure O
the O
best O
place O
on O
the O
coach O
for O
me O
; O
but O
on O
making O
inquiries O
as O
to O
details O
he O
seemed O
somewhat O
reticent O
, O
and O
pretended O
that O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
my O
German O
. O
This O
could O
not O
be O
true O
, O
because O
up O
to O
then O
he O
had O
understood O
it O
perfectly O
; O
at O
least O
, O
he O
answered O
my O
questions O
exactly O
as O
if O
he O
did O
. O
He O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
who O
had O
received O
me O
, O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
in O
a O
frightened O
sort O
of O
way O
. O
He O
mumbled O
out O
that O
the O
money O
had O
been O
sent O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
that O
was O
all O
he O
knew O
. O
When O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
knew O
Count I-PERSON
Dracula I-PERSON
, O
and O
could O
tell O
me O
anything O
of O
his O
castle O
, O
both O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
crossed O
themselves O
, O
and O
, O
saying O
that O
they O
knew O
nothing O
at O
all O
, O
simply O
refused O
to O
speak O
further O
. O
It O
was O
so O
near O
the O
time O
of O
starting O
that O
I O
had O
no O
time O
to O
ask O
any O
one O
else O
, O
for O
it O
was O
all O
very O
mysterious O
and O
not O
by O
any O
means O
comforting O
. O
Just O
before O
I O
was O
leaving O
, O
the O
old O
lady O
came O
up O
to O
my O
room O
and O
said O
in O
a O
very O
hysterical O
way O
: O
` O
Must O
you O
go O
? O
Oh O
! O
young O
Herr O
, O
must O
you O
go O
? O
' O
She O
was O
in O
such O
an O
excited O
state O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
her O
grip O
of O
what O
German O
she O
knew O
, O
and O
mixed O
it O
all O
up O
with O
some O
other O
language O
which O
I O
did O
not O
know O
at O
all O
. O
I O
was O
just O
able O
to O
follow O
her O
by O
asking O
many O
questions O
. O
When O
I O
told O
her O
that O
I O
must O
go O
at O
once O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
engaged O
on O
important O
business O
, O
she O
asked O
again O
: O
` O
Do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
' O
I O
answered O
that O
it O
was O
the O
fourth O
of O
May O
. O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
as O
she O
said O
again O
: O
` O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
I O
know O
that O
! O
I O
know O
that O
, O
but O
do O
you O
know O
what O
day O
it O
is O
? O
' O
On O
my O
saying O
that O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
, O
she O
went O
on O
: O
` O
It O
is O
the O
eve O
of O
St. O
George O
's O
Day O
. O
Do O
you O
not O
know O
that O
to O
- O
night O
, O
when O
the O
clock O
strikes O
midnight O
, O
all O
the O
evil O
things O
in O
the O
world O
will O
have O
full O
sway O
? O
Do O
you O
know O
where O
you O
are O
going O
, O
and O
what O
you O
are O
going O
to O
? O
' O
She O
was O
in O
such O
evident O
distress O
that O
I O
tried O
to O
comfort O
her O
, O
but O
without O
effect O
. O
Finally O
she O
went O
down O
on O
her O
knees O
and O
implored O
me O
not O
to O
go O
; O
at O
least O
to O
wait O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
starting O
. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
ridiculous O
but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
. O
However O
, O
there O
was O
business O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
I O
could O
allow O
nothing O
to O
interfere O
with O
it O
. O
I O
therefore O
tried O
to O
raise O
her O
up O
, O
and O
said O
, O
as O
gravely O
as O
I O
could O
, O
that O
I O
thanked O
her O
, O
but O
my O
duty O
was O
imperative O
, O
and O
that O
I O
must O
go O
. O
She O
then O
rose O
and O
dried O
her O
eyes O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
crucifix O
from O
her O
neck O
offered O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
for O
, O
as O
an O
English O
Churchman O
, O
I O
have O
been O
taught O
to O
regard O
such O
things O
as O
in O
some O
measure O
idolatrous O
, O
and O
yet O
it O
seemed O
so O
ungracious O
to O
refuse O
an O
old O
lady O
meaning O
so O
well O
and O
in O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
. O
She O
saw O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
the O
doubt O
in O
my O
face O
, O
for O
she O
put O
the O
rosary O
round O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
said O
, O
` O
For O
your O
mother O
's O
sake O
, O
' O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
I O
am O
writing O
up O
this O
part O
of O
the O
diary O
whilst O
I O
am O
waiting O
for O
the O
coach O
, O
which O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
late O
; O
and O
the O
crucifix O
is O
still O
round O
my O
neck O
. O
Whether O
it O
is O
the O
old O
lady O
's O
fear O
, O
or O
the O
many O
ghostly O
traditions O
of O
this O
place O
, O
or O
the O
crucifix O
itself O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
feeling O
nearly O
as O
easy O
in O
my O
mind O
as O
usual O
. O
If O
this O
book O
should O
ever O
reach O
Mina O
before O
I O
do O
, O
let O
it O
bring O
my O
good O
- O
bye O
. O
Here O
comes O
the O
coach O
! O

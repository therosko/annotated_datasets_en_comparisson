Call O
me O
Ishmael I-PERSON
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
-- O
never O
mind O
how O
long O
precisely O
-- O
having O
little O
or O
no O
money O
in O
my O
purse O
, O
and O
nothing O
particular O
to O
interest O
me O
on O
shore O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
sail O
about O
a O
little O
and O
see O
the O
watery O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O
It O
is O
a O
way O
I O
have O
of O
driving O
off O
the O
spleen O
and O
regulating O
the O
circulation O
. O
Whenever O
I O
find O
myself O
growing O
grim O
about O
the O
mouth O
; O
whenever O
it O
is O
a O
damp O
, O
drizzly O
November O
in O
my O
soul O
; O
whenever O
I O
find O
myself O
involuntarily O
pausing O
before O
coffin O
warehouses O
, O
and O
bringing O
up O
the O
rear O
of O
every O
funeral O
I O
meet O
; O
and O
especially O
whenever O
my O
hypos O
get O
such O
an O
upper O
hand O
of O
me O
, O
that O
it O
requires O
a O
strong O
moral O
principle O
to O
prevent O
me O
from O
deliberately O
stepping O
into O
the O
street O
, O
and O
methodically O
knocking O
people O
's O
hats O
off O
-- O
then O
, O
I O
account O
it O
high O
time O
to O
get O
to O
sea O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
can O
. O
This O
is O
my O
substitute O
for O
pistol O
and O
ball O
. O
With O
a O
philosophical O
flourish O
Cato I-PERSON
throws O
himself O
upon O
his O
sword O
; O
I O
quietly O
take O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
surprising O
in O
this O
. O
If O
they O
but O
knew O
it O
, O
almost O
all O
men O
in O
their O
degree O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
cherish O
very O
nearly O
the O
same O
feelings O
towards O
the O
ocean O
with O
me O
. O
There O
now O
is O
your O
insular O
city O
of O
the O
Manhattoes O
, O
belted O
round O
by O
wharves O
as O
Indian O
isles O
by O
coral O
reefs O
-- O
commerce O
surrounds O
it O
with O
her O
surf O
. O
Right O
and O
left O
, O
the O
streets O
take O
you O
waterward O
. O
Its O
extreme O
downtown O
is O
the O
battery O
, O
where O
that O
noble O
mole O
is O
washed O
by O
waves O
, O
and O
cooled O
by O
breezes O
, O
which O
a O
few O
hours O
previous O
were O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
. O
Look O
at O
the O
crowds O
of O
water O
- O
gazers O
there O
. O
Circumambulate O
the O
city O
of O
a O
dreamy O
Sabbath O
afternoon O
. O
Go O
from O
Corlears O
Hook O
to O
Coenties O
Slip O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
, O
by O
Whitehall O
, O
northward O
. O
What O
do O
you O
see O
? O
-- O
Posted O
like O
silent O
sentinels O
all O
around O
the O
town O
, O
stand O
thousands O
upon O
thousands O
of O
mortal O
men O
fixed O
in O
ocean O
reveries O
. O
Some O
leaning O
against O
the O
spiles O
; O
some O
seated O
upon O
the O
pier O
- O
heads O
; O
some O
looking O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
of O
ships O
from O
China O
; O
some O
high O
aloft O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
as O
if O
striving O
to O
get O
a O
still O
better O
seaward O
peep O
. O
But O
these O
are O
all O
landsmen O
; O
of O
week O
days O
pent O
up O
in O
lath O
and O
plaster O
-- O
tied O
to O
counters O
, O
nailed O
to O
benches O
, O
clinched O
to O
desks O
. O
How O
then O
is O
this O
? O
Are O
the O
green O
fields O
gone O
? O
What O
do O
they O
here O
? O
But O
look O
! O
here O
come O
more O
crowds O
, O
pacing O
straight O
for O
the O
water O
, O
and O
seemingly O
bound O
for O
a O
dive O
. O
Strange O
! O
Nothing O
will O
content O
them O
but O
the O
extremest O
limit O
of O
the O
land O
; O
loitering O
under O
the O
shady O
lee O
of O
yonder O
warehouses O
will O
not O
suffice O
. O
No O
. O
They O
must O
get O
just O
as O
nigh O
the O
water O
as O
they O
possibly O
can O
without O
falling O
in O
. O
And O
there O
they O
stand O
-- O
miles O
of O
them O
-- O
leagues O
. O
Inlanders O
all O
, O
they O
come O
from O
lanes O
and O
alleys O
, O
streets O
and O
avenues O
-- O
north O
, O
east O
, O
south O
, O
and O
west O
. O
Yet O
here O
they O
all O
unite O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
does O
the O
magnetic O
virtue O
of O
the O
needles O
of O
the O
compasses O
of O
all O
those O
ships O
attract O
them O
thither O
? O
Once O
more O
. O
Say O
you O
are O
in O
the O
country O
; O
in O
some O
high O
land O
of O
lakes O
. O
Take O
almost O
any O
path O
you O
please O
, O
and O
ten O
to O
one O
it O
carries O
you O
down O
in O
a O
dale O
, O
and O
leaves O
you O
there O
by O
a O
pool O
in O
the O
stream O
. O
There O
is O
magic O
in O
it O
. O
Let O
the O
most O
absent O
- O
minded O
of O
men O
be O
plunged O
in O
his O
deepest O
reveries O
-- O
stand O
that O
man O
on O
his O
legs O
, O
set O
his O
feet O
a O
- O
going O
, O
and O
he O
will O
infallibly O
lead O
you O
to O
water O
, O
if O
water O
there O
be O
in O
all O
that O
region O
. O
Should O
you O
ever O
be O
athirst O
in O
the O
great O
American O
desert O
, O
try O
this O
experiment O
, O
if O
your O
caravan O
happen O
to O
be O
supplied O
with O
a O
metaphysical O
professor O
. O
Yes O
, O
as O
every O
one O
knows O
, O
meditation O
and O
water O
are O
wedded O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
here O
is O
an O
artist O
. O
He O
desires O
to O
paint O
you O
the O
dreamiest O
, O
shadiest O
, O
quietest O
, O
most O
enchanting O
bit O
of O
romantic O
landscape O
in O
all O
the O
valley O
of O
the O
Saco O
. O
What O
is O
the O
chief O
element O
he O
employs O
? O
There O
stand O
his O
trees O
, O
each O
with O
a O
hollow O
trunk O
, O
as O
if O
a O
hermit O
and O
a O
crucifix O
were O
within O
; O
and O
here O
sleeps O
his O
meadow O
, O
and O
there O
sleep O
his O
cattle O
; O
and O
up O
from O
yonder O
cottage O
goes O
a O
sleepy O
smoke O
. O
Deep O
into O
distant O
woodlands O
winds O
a O
mazy O
way O
, O
reaching O
to O
overlapping O
spurs O
of O
mountains O
bathed O
in O
their O
hill O
- O
side O
blue O
. O
But O
though O
the O
picture O
lies O
thus O
tranced O
, O
and O
though O
this O
pine O
- O
tree O
shakes O
down O
its O
sighs O
like O
leaves O
upon O
this O
shepherd O
's O
head O
, O
yet O
all O
were O
vain O
, O
unless O
the O
shepherd O
's O
eye O
were O
fixed O
upon O
the O
magic O
stream O
before O
him O
. O
Go O
visit O
the O
Prairies O
in O
June O
, O
when O
for O
scores O
on O
scores O
of O
miles O
you O
wade O
knee O
- O
deep O
among O
Tiger O
- O
lilies O
-- O
what O
is O
the O
one O
charm O
wanting O
? O
-- O
Water O
there O
is O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
there O
! O
Were O
Niagara O
but O
a O
cataract O
of O
sand O
, O
would O
you O
travel O
your O
thousand O
miles O
to O
see O
it O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
poor O
poet O
of O
Tennessee O
, O
upon O
suddenly O
receiving O
two O
handfuls O
of O
silver O
, O
deliberate O
whether O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
coat O
, O
which O
he O
sadly O
needed O
, O
or O
invest O
his O
money O
in O
a O
pedestrian O
trip O
to O
Rockaway O
Beach O
? O
Why O
is O
almost O
every O
robust O
healthy O
boy O
with O
a O
robust O
healthy O
soul O
in O
him O
, O
at O
some O
time O
or O
other O
crazy O
to O
go O
to O
sea O
? O
Why O
upon O
your O
first O
voyage O
as O
a O
passenger O
, O
did O
you O
yourself O
feel O
such O
a O
mystical O
vibration O
, O
when O
first O
told O
that O
you O
and O
your O
ship O
were O
now O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
old O
Persians O
hold O
the O
sea O
holy O
? O
Why O
did O
the O
Greeks O
give O
it O
a O
separate O
deity O
, O
and O
own O
brother O
of O
Jove I-PERSON
? O
Surely O
all O
this O
is O
not O
without O
meaning O
. O
And O
still O
deeper O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
story O
of O
Narcissus O
, O
who O
because O
he O
could O
not O
grasp O
the O
tormenting O
, O
mild O
image O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
fountain O
, O
plunged O
into O
it O
and O
was O
drowned O
. O
But O
that O
same O
image O
, O
we O
ourselves O
see O
in O
all O
rivers O
and O
oceans O
. O
It O
is O
the O
image O
of O
the O
ungraspable O
phantom O
of O
life O
; O
and O
this O
is O
the O
key O
to O
it O
all O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
I O
say O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
going O
to O
sea O
whenever O
I O
begin O
to O
grow O
hazy O
about O
the O
eyes O
, O
and O
begin O
to O
be O
over O
conscious O
of O
my O
lungs O
, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
have O
it O
inferred O
that O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
passenger O
. O
For O
to O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
you O
must O
needs O
have O
a O
purse O
, O
and O
a O
purse O
is O
but O
a O
rag O
unless O
you O
have O
something O
in O
it O
. O
Besides O
, O
passengers O
get O
sea O
- O
sick O
-- O
grow O
quarrelsome O
-- O
do O
n't O
sleep O
of O
nights O
-- O
do O
not O
enjoy O
themselves O
much O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
; O
-- O
no O
, O
I O
never O
go O
as O
a O
passenger O
; O
nor O
, O
though O
I O
am O
something O
of O
a O
salt O
, O
do O
I O
ever O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
Commodore O
, O
or O
a O
Captain O
, O
or O
a O
Cook O
. O
I O
abandon O
the O
glory O
and O
distinction O
of O
such O
offices O
to O
those O
who O
like O
them O
. O
For O
my O
part O
, O
I O
abominate O
all O
honourable O
respectable O
toils O
, O
trials O
, O
and O
tribulations O
of O
every O
kind O
whatsoever O
. O
It O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
do O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
, O
without O
taking O
care O
of O
ships O
, O
barques O
, O
brigs O
, O
schooners O
, O
and O
what O
not O
. O
And O
as O
for O
going O
as O
cook O
, O
-- O
though O
I O
confess O
there O
is O
considerable O
glory O
in O
that O
, O
a O
cook O
being O
a O
sort O
of O
officer O
on O
ship O
- O
board O
-- O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
I O
never O
fancied O
broiling O
fowls O
; O
-- O
though O
once O
broiled O
, O
judiciously O
buttered O
, O
and O
judgmatically O
salted O
and O
peppered O
, O
there O
is O
no O
one O
who O
will O
speak O
more O
respectfully O
, O
not O
to O
say O
reverentially O
, O
of O
a O
broiled O
fowl O
than O
I O
will O
. O
It O
is O
out O
of O
the O
idolatrous O
dotings O
of O
the O
old O
Egyptians O
upon O
broiled O
ibis O
and O
roasted O
river O
horse O
, O
that O
you O
see O
the O
mummies O
of O
those O
creatures O
in O
their O
huge O
bakehouses O
the O
pyramids O
. O
No O
, O
when O
I O
go O
to O
sea O
, O
I O
go O
as O
a O
simple O
sailor O
, O
right O
before O
the O
mast O
, O
plumb O
down O
into O
the O
fore O
- O
castle O
, O
aloft O
there O
to O
the O
royal O
mast O
- O
head O
. O
True O
, O
they O
rather O
order O
me O
about O
some O
, O
and O
make O
me O
jump O
from O
spar O
to O
spar O
, O
like O
a O
grasshopper O
in O
a O
May O
meadow O
. O
And O
at O
first O
, O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
unpleasant O
enough O
. O
It O
touches O
one O
's O
sense O
of O
honour O
, O
particularly O
if O
you O
come O
of O
an O
old O
established O
family O
in O
the O
land O
, O
the O
Van O
Rensselaers O
, O
or O
Randolphs O
, O
or O
Hardicanutes O
. O
And O
more O
than O
all O
, O
if O
just O
previous O
to O
putting O
your O
hand O
into O
the O
tar O
- O
pot O
, O
you O
have O
been O
lording O
it O
as O
a O
country O
schoolmaster O
, O
making O
the O
tallest O
boys O
stand O
in O
awe O
of O
you O
. O
The O
transition O
is O
a O
keen O
one O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
from O
a O
schoolmaster O
to O
a O
sailor O
, O
and O
requires O
a O
strong O
decoction O
of O
Seneca O
and O
the O
Stoics O
to O
enable O
you O
to O
grin O
and O
bear O
it O
. O
But O
even O
this O
wears O
off O
in O
time O
. O
What O
of O
it O
, O
if O
some O
old O
hunks O
of O
a O
sea O
- O
captain O
orders O
me O
to O
get O
a O
broom O
and O
sweep O
down O
the O
decks O
? O
What O
does O
that O
indignity O
amount O
to O
, O
weighed O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
in O
the O
scales O
of O
the O
New O
Testament O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
the O
archangel O
Gabriel O
thinks O
anything O
the O
less O
of O
me O
, O
because O
I O
promptly O
and O
respectfully O
obey O
that O
old O
hunks O
in O
that O
particular O
instance O
? O
Who O
ai O
n't O
a O
slave O
? O
Tell O
me O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
however O
the O
old O
sea O
- O
captains O
may O
order O
me O
about O
-- O
however O
they O
may O
thump O
and O
punch O
me O
about O
, O
I O
have O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
knowing O
that O
it O
is O
all O
right O
; O
that O
everybody O
else O
is O
one O
way O
or O
other O
served O
in O
much O
the O
same O
way O
-- O
either O
in O
a O
physical O
or O
metaphysical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
that O
is O
; O
and O
so O
the O
universal O
thump O
is O
passed O
round O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
should O
rub O
each O
other O
's O
shoulder O
- O
blades O
, O
and O
be O
content O
. O
Again O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
they O
make O
a O
point O
of O
paying O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
, O
whereas O
they O
never O
pay O
passengers O
a O
single O
penny O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
passengers O
themselves O
must O
pay O
. O
And O
there O
is O
all O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
world O
between O
paying O
and O
being O
paid O
. O
The O
act O
of O
paying O
is O
perhaps O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
infliction O
that O
the O
two O
orchard O
thieves O
entailed O
upon O
us O
. O
But O
being O
paid O
, O
-- O
what O
will O
compare O
with O
it O
? O
The O
urbane O
activity O
with O
which O
a O
man O
receives O
money O
is O
really O
marvellous O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
so O
earnestly O
believe O
money O
to O
be O
the O
root O
of O
all O
earthly O
ills O
, O
and O
that O
on O
no O
account O
can O
a O
monied O
man O
enter O
heaven O
. O
Ah O
! O
how O
cheerfully O
we O
consign O
ourselves O
to O
perdition O
! O
Finally O
, O
I O
always O
go O
to O
sea O
as O
a O
sailor O
, O
because O
of O
the O
wholesome O
exercise O
and O
pure O
air O
of O
the O
fore O
- O
castle O
deck O
. O
For O
as O
in O
this O
world O
, O
head O
winds O
are O
far O
more O
prevalent O
than O
winds O
from O
astern O
-LRB- O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
never O
violate O
the O
Pythagorean O
maxim O
-RRB- O
, O
so O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
Commodore O
on O
the O
quarter O
- O
deck O
gets O
his O
atmosphere O
at O
second O
hand O
from O
the O
sailors O
on O
the O
forecastle O
. O
He O
thinks O
he O
breathes O
it O
first O
; O
but O
not O
so O
. O
In O
much O
the O
same O
way O
do O
the O
commonalty O
lead O
their O
leaders O
in O
many O
other O
things O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
the O
leaders O
little O
suspect O
it O
. O
But O
wherefore O
it O
was O
that O
after O
having O
repeatedly O
smelt O
the O
sea O
as O
a O
merchant O
sailor O
, O
I O
should O
now O
take O
it O
into O
my O
head O
to O
go O
on O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
; O
this O
the O
invisible O
police O
officer O
of O
the O
Fates O
, O
who O
has O
the O
constant O
surveillance O
of O
me O
, O
and O
secretly O
dogs O
me O
, O
and O
influences O
me O
in O
some O
unaccountable O
way O
-- O
he O
can O
better O
answer O
than O
any O
one O
else O
. O
And O
, O
doubtless O
, O
my O
going O
on O
this O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
formed O
part O
of O
the O
grand O
programme O
of O
Providence O
that O
was O
drawn O
up O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
. O
It O
came O
in O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
brief O
interlude O
and O
solo O
between O
more O
extensive O
performances O
. O
I O
take O
it O
that O
this O
part O
of O
the O
bill O
must O
have O
run O
something O
like O
this O
